# Single-Player-TicTacToe
Android app for playing tictactoe by yourself

Download app-release.apk on an android device and install the app to play.

The ai is programmed to never allow a trivial win, that is, the only way for the player to win is to perform a double trap. The Ai will attempt to win, then attempt to block a player win, and if neither condition is present, the ai will simple make a random move. 

Order of turns is randomly determined at the start of each round.
